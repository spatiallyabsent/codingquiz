# codingquiz
had to build a timed coding quiz with multiple questions that saved user data on local files and displayed it back to the user at the end of the game.
There had to be penalties for wrong answers in the quiz by subtracting time from the clock for each wrong answer.
We were asked to have at least 5 questions.
We had to write the JavaScript, html, and css from scratch.
